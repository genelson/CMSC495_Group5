I will post this in its own document but here are the query statements that work.  I just added more records
to the database with these statements.  If you intend to leave it blank, you must still use the first line and 
on the second line place a blank space   ''   where that field would go.  

insert into movie (title, type, rating, length, year_released, director)
values ('Life of Pi', 'Adventrue','PG','127 min', '2012', "not sure");

insert into dvd_video (movie_id, serial_no, late_fee)
values ('1', '1D1 ', '2.5');


insert into customer (last_name, first_name, street_address, city, state, zip_code, phone, hold_on_account)
values ('Jones', 'James','123 J Street','Fallbrook','CA','92028','123456789','1');

The hold on account is either a 1 or a 0 for true or false.  It doesn't matter, just needs to be consistant.

insert into rental (cust_id, date_out, movie_id, late_fees_paid)
values ('1', date '2013-09-01','1','5.25');

Below are the search and delete scripts.  I noticed in the Interface control 2.4.1 the requirment is for the user to
all the required information in the search page.  There would be no reason to search if that were the case.  I have
built the basic one piece options.  I can create any number of combinations such as type (adventure) and rating (pg)
that you would like, but think that maybe the front end would be easier with a search by screen that uses the scripts.

The variables must match the type of data in the database.  Right now there are no directors listed for any of the 
movies.

This should let everyone start and I will finish when I get off work.
select  last_name, first_name from customer where cust_id = 'variable';
select cust_id, last_name, first_name, phone from customer where last_name = 'variable';
select * from movie; 
select movie_id, title from movie where type = 'variable';
select movie_id, title from movie where rating = 'variable';
select movie_id, title from movie where length = 'variable';
select movie_id, title from movie where year_released = 'variable';
select movie_id, title from movie where director = 'variable';
delete from customer where cust_id ='variable';
delete from movie where movie_id ='variable';

update customer set last_name = 'new value' where cust_id = 'variable';
update customer set phone = 'new value' where cust_id ='variable';
